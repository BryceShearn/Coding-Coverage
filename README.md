This was a week-long sprint use Agile Methodologies to exceed the minimum viable product we set forth

### Overview:

*<b>Why?</b> Coding Coverage was conceptualized created and brought to life by a team of three with a mission to improve the process of reaching the end state of becoming a Software Developer aimed towards self-taught programmers in order to provide guidance, roadmaps, community resources, community engagement for motivation, and the opportunity for expert volunteers to offer insight or help to others in order to benefit the future of Software Development!

This program is designed to be a full stack website application that creates, reads, updates and deletes users progress as well as community contribution data in the form of comments from a database we built using MySQL Workbench and connecting with using Java Database Connectivity.

### How to run:

First, the user enters the index page. The user can choose to:
* Register as a user
* Login if already a user

Java Libraries: SQL, List, and handling exceptions.

Object-Oriented Programming in Java: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

Test Driven Development using JUNIT Juniper.

### Lessons learned:

This project helped us better grasp the capabilities of Dynamic Web Applications by allowing us to better learn how to:
* Build a multi-table database using MySQL Workbench.
* Be an Agile development team
* Use branching on Git/GitHub
* Understand Spring Application Contexts.
* Use the Java Persistence API to generate HTML.
* Build a Dynamic Web Applications using Spring MVC.
* Improved Javascript understanding and abilities, CCS and Bootstrap to have a better understanding and improved abiltiies of Front End Development.
